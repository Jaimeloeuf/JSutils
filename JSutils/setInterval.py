from threading import Timer

""" @Todos
	- Create a method that will call the stop method when the process exits. Because the timer thread continues to run
	  even if the main program/thread is killed by keyboard interrupt, which means that the stop method is never called.
	- Create a method that allows user to specify if the interval should start running immediately. Meaning that I can create
	  the interval and store the reference first without letting it run, this is so to allow me to do some settings/changes to
	  the object first, or to allow user to only execute this 'loop' when certain conditions are met.
	- Create a method/check for the user to specify how many times this interval should run. So example would be, I only
	  want this interval based loop to loop a maximum of 10 times before I want it to automatically stop.
	  Or perhaps a time limit for how long this loop should loop for, like loopFor(10mins), meaning after 10 mins, the loop
	  should call self.stop method. This can be possibly implemented by using another 'kill interval' timer that calls the
	  stop method upon timeout.
